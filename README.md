# PHP5.6 + Apache 

This modified DIY cartridge provides PHP 5.6.28 and fully free Apache configuration permission, which can be found in `conf` folder.

## Quick Start

1. Open https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_type/cart!diy-0.1 
2. Fill **Source Code** text field: `https://github.com/culdev/openshift-php5.6-cgi-apache.git`
3. Click **Create Application** and wait
4. Open your website (e.g. foo-bar.rhcloud.com ) and keep your browser running. Meanwhile, you can `git clone` your app to your computer and start coding.
5. **IMPORTANT** : your first `git push` shall NOT be earlier than the first building ends

### Tips

* The first building lasts for ~20 minutes, the progress can be seen on your app page (eg. https://foo-bar.rhcloud.com )
* By default, PHP 5.6.28 is choosen, which can be found in `misc/make.sh`
* Once you modified `conf/httpd.conf`, you must reload your app, or run `${OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR}/.openshift/action_hooks/reload`, to make it works.
